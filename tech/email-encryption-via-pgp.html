                Encrypting your emails via PGP keys is a rather simple job. By using PGP-encryption for your emails, you can encrypt messages you would like to send to friends, random people online, and more. You will find this guide useful if you are confused on how to do it! Below is a table of contents for this guide.

                <h2 id="before">Pre-Requisites</h2>
                First of all, you will need to have an email client compatible with PGP-encryption either natively or via extensions. We will be using <a href="https://thunderbird.net/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a> due to the fact it has PGP-encryption built into the email client, though other clients thats support it natively or via <a href="https://enigmail.net/">extensions</a> would also work. Due to the convenience of Thunderbird, we will be using it for this tutorial.
                <h2 id="warning">Cautions About PGP-Encryption</h2>
                There are some things you should be warned about when using PGP-encryption. They will be listed below.
                <br><br>
                1. Loss Of Messages<br>
                If you lose your old PGP key and make a new one, you will not be able to decrypt your old messages. Also, any new messages encrypted with that key will have to be resent by the original sender except with the new PGP key or no encryption at all.
                <br><br>
                2. Private Keys<br>
                If you give anyone the private key or if someone else gets it, you might as well consider that key worthless as they can decrypt any message you have if they manage to get access to your messages. I would not recommend sharing private keys for this reason. Sharing your public-key is fine though.
                <br><br>
                Despite these reasons, there are many good things about PGP-encryption! No one, not even the email-host such as Microsoft or Google, can see your emails as long as you don't give the private key to anyone else. Also, messages sent that are encrypted with your private key are signed and encrypted so you know damn well no one changed your message while sending it. Due to keys having different signatures, you can also determine if someone is hacked or not in some cases (such as when communicating with people wanted by elites).
