                <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
                First of all, the current state of Paint is dissapointing. For one, we have a lack of activity, but we also don't have extreme freedoms like we did in early-2022. Paint is suffering from being in the worst state a website could be in right now I believe. The worst state your site can be in is dead with little fun, that is where we are at right now. Secondly, the site is broken after years. This goes back far before the modern Paint era, but it certainly does not help. We must find a way to fix the websites code or make it again from scratch while retaining the same look. The former is easier and far better of an idea anyways.
                <br><br>
                That is not all however, as we must figure out, why do these things happen? Well it is not 100% clear why half the site is broken, why the site is dead, and why there still are admin issues despite most of the admins being actually quite notable and usually chill about the rules. My guess isn't exact, but I aim to figure out all of Paint's problems with this piece and ways to fix them.
                <br><br>
                Note: If you decide to read further, you will need to read the terms section. This is to establish basic terms that I will be using throughout the manifesto for those that are unfamiliar with Paint's community or those who are simply not up-to-date with the current terms as they change occasionally.
                <h2 id="terms">Terms</h2>
                SDK/SDKCommunity: Name used to describe all of 3DSPaint, DSiPaint, HullBreach Online, and other SDK/HullBreach related services/applications.<br>
                DCE: D(igital) C(heese) Empire<br>
                TDK: <a href="https://tdk.venith.net/">The Destruction Kingdom</a><br>
                SDKcord: (Un)official Discord server for SDK.
                AMAB: All Mods Are Bitches (meme of ACAB)
                Overlord: The highest moderator role a user can achieve other than owner, which is reserved for HullBreach. Has all admin powers + flashing name in chatrooms.<br>
                CSS: Cascading Style Sheet(s), used to customize web-pages including Paint profiles.<br>
                TMJ: The Mystical Journey
                <h2 id=issues>SDK's Issues</h2>
                Despite it seeming like a bad idea to start something that is supposed to encourage SDK becoming great again with it's issues instead of circlejerking that the website is good and its just one issue, there are actual issues SDK suffers from.
                <h4 id="issues-a">A. Broken Pages</h4>
                The majority of SDK's pages are broken either partially or fully. A good majority of the pages would be partially broken instead of fully broken, but a good majority of those would easily be considered fully broken if one more thing broke.
                <br><br>
                Partially broken pages often function as intended, but they lack dark-mode CSS or parts or the page look a bit weird. They are mosty fine, sometimes you can even fix the issue on the client-side making things easier to use until HullBreach manages to fix it. For example, the bulletin boards would be partially broken because you are unable to reply to threads, but you are still able to read everything that has been posted and never deleted.
                <br><br>
                <img src="/assets/misc/makepaintgreatagain/issues-a_1.png" alt="Partially Broken Page - Merely Light Mode Being Broken, But Otherwise Functional" title="Example Of Partially Broken Page">
                <br><br>
                Fully broken technically can load in some cases, but nothing actually works on the page as intended. The SDK library would be an example of this due to it's lack of an ability to read any of the books currently "available" along with it's lack of an ability to submit new books.
                <br><br>
                <img src="/assets/misc/makepaintgreatagain/issues-a_2.png" alt="Fully Broken Page - Library Book Submission Having Both Broken CSS And Trying To Do Anything Seemingly Fails" title="Example Of Fully Broken Page">
                <br><br>
                Needless to say, we at least need to get SDK to have partially functioning pages for every page, preferably fully functioning though.
                <h4 id="issues-b">B. Lack Of Activity</h4>
                The lack of activity on SDK is pretty major as well. There are not any exact statistics about SDK unforunately, but we can take a guess based off it's blogs, polls, and groups due to the fact they are the least broken parts of the site + the most active.
                <br><br>
                Considering blogs and polls at most can get a consistent 10-15 votes, along with groups often having the same 10 or so people, we can conclude 10-15 frequent users is around where SDK is activity-wise. There are many more members and you can make the number go up to around 20 active users if you include people who simply aren't posting a lot.
                <br><br>
                How is the entire site carried by 10-15 people yet manages to have not one, but two top groups within the same year? The math does not add up until you consider that this is purely who is active, not who joins then leaves after a short amount of time. Frequently people will be active for a little while tuen forget about the site.
                <br><br>
                There are several reasons for this I believe. For one, most users join and believe they will be active, and then they get bored and go back to doom-scrolling on a mainstream website like YouTube, Twitter, etc. Also, many users actually stay active until life gets them, and then they start being less active. Finally, the last reason I can think of is that there are some members who are experiencing burnout from this website. Some are more extreme and will still be active, just taking things slower like me. Others just stop using the site for a few months-years, and this is pretty much inevitable because Paint has been around since 2009.
                <br><br>
                The activity question is a hard one to solve due to the fact that you no longer can do everything yourself, but must rely on others to help out. Yes, you can make alt accounts to interact with each other. However, is that even good for the site? You can't pretend it's not your alternative accounrs forever so you eventually have to stop using them and make the site look deader or just admit they are your accounts.
                <br><br>
                I will note that activity would pick up if SDK's other issues are solved due to the fact some people get bored because it is all broken or there are some admins who like to ruin the fun. There is a fine line between fun and being an issue for SDK, however we have not crossed it yet and if we have, it would have been in late-2021 when I would spam Eminem lyrics to be edgy or it would have been in early-2022 when people posted PornHub links and spammed everyone's notifications before we discovered how to actually spam them so badly that we could break the site (which is where an actual line should be drawn).
                <h4 id="issues-c">C. The Anti-SDK Establishment</h4>
                The Anti-SDK "establishment" isn't actually any group named that or anything similar, it is simply what I will use to refer to people who actively sabotage SDK's activity unknowingly or advocating for SDK's death blatantly. The only reason they pose any threat is because this unofficial "establishment" happens to have admins of the website. The Anti-SDK establishment is expanded upon <a href=#anti-sdk>further below</a>, but if they did not have at least 1 administrator (with ban perms) on their side, they would be harmless and thus not mentioned except as a meme to laugh at.
                <h4 id="issues-d">D. Miscallenous Issues</h4>
                The rest of this is minor things that are probably not gonna change much if done, but I would enjoy if they were changed, added or fixed.
                <br><br>
                Joining Groups Without Invites<br>
                Private Groups<br>
                Group Threads Or Blogs + Actual Chatroom (Shoutbox For Announcements)<br>
                TMJ Being Finished<br>
                Blog Contests Again + Things To Get Other Now Unobtainable Badges (Despite How Few There Are)<br>
                And more minor quality of life improvements.
                <h2 id="solutions">Solutions?</h2>
                Instead of bitching about SDK's issues and not doing anything about it, I am going to actually try to solve things around here.
                <h4 id="solutions-a">A. Fix Pages</h4>
                This one is the most obvious. Just fix the pages that are broken. Some of them are merely CSS issues and thus you could change the stylesheet a bit and be done. Hell, you might fix other previously brokeb parts too. Carefulness is needed in order to not break more, but this is an easy fix.
                <br><br>
                Not all problems on the site are just CSS, but often backend so I can't really help there. I have a good enough idea of PHP to be able to use it, but not good enough for it to be possible for me to just fix everything. Plus thats assuming another language isn't used as well.
                <br><br>
                However, if you fix the pages not working as intended then more people stay because it actually works. They also stay for longer. I am glad HullBreach has fixed email verification though, it was broken for years before he did so earlier this year. We need more major fixes like that I believe to make things go better on this front.
                <br><br>
                Temporary Solutions To CSS (will likely not be perfect):<br>
                <a href="https://userstyles.world/style/9639">Better Darkmode</a><br>
                <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=101045">AMOLED Theme</a>
                <h4 id="solutions-b">B. Increase The Activity</h4>
                Increasing the activity is pretty annoying to figure out how to do unless we want to bring idiots jnto this website. However, if we don't get activity then the website dies. As a result, I have a few ideas.
                <br><br>
                First off, start linking things via 3DSPaint links. Tutorials, stories you're writing that you aren't planning on selling as a book, etc. I might actually do the same thing for certain things and simply port things over to the archives at the same time. They should be done as blogs until the bulletins are fixed, in which case those would be better in some cases such as for actual discussion due to it's forum-like approach to things.
                <br><br>
                Second off, actually use the website. That would be a major help and it's what I've dedicated a lot of my time to. I want Paint to be great again, but complaining its dead and not doing anything about it will never help anyone. Be active, or quit complaining Paint is dead because you aren't even trying.
                <br><br>
                Thirdly, host events on the site. Preferably ones that won't be impossible to get people organized on even under perfect time-circumstances due to how many people still use DSi or 3DS for the website. Pokemon Tournaments, art competitons, etc. That gives people a reason to stay and sometimes encourages more activity because people are having FUN, not saying "gay sex uwu" for the millionth time this month.
                <br><br>
                To end off the ways to revive SDK, create your own group. I made DCE and its at 116 members, I made TDK and its at 82 members. Even on SDK, you can easily get members for your group. If you use other platforms, invite those members to the Paint version of the group. Its not hard, you can do what I do.
                <h4 id="solutions-c">C. Anti-SDK Establishment</h4>
                The Anti-SDK establishment is both hard to defeat and almost pointless. The main way I can think of to defeat them is to get more admins + overlords on our side, however that itself is hard. Unless HullBreach granted admin or there were very major movements to get someone else as admin, good luck. I'd root for Draconid_Jo here due to his basically perfect reputation even on the Discord + him being a bit like me in that he wants to revive SDK. Due to how long I can go on about them, they are part of a different section called <a href="#antisdk">Anti-SDKer Hell</a>
                <h2 id="antisdk">Anti-SDKer Hell</h2>
                If you have not already, I would recommend going back and reading what <a href="#terms">Anti-SDKer means</a> as to avoid confusion. As said in the definition, even overlords could be "Anti-SDK", but it is basically impossible. The biggest Anti-SDKer group is (ironically) the "unofficial" SDK Discord, referred to as SDKcord.
                <h4 id="antisdk-a">A. Why They Are An Issue</h4>
                We already know they aren't good for SDK for obvious reasons, however they are an issue that should be paid attention to due to the fact they will sabotage plans to revive it, or at least they have demonstrated they will harm my own revival plans (which are the biggest and basically only plans as of now). It is mostly that one admin who has ban privileges is part of what I would call "the anti-SDK establishment".
                <h4 id="antisdk-b">B. What They Do To SDK</h4>
                The "establishment" (if you want to call it that) essentially tries to kill off any actual progress of SDK. They're all Paint members or were once, and very rarely is it even "unintentional" as most seriously suggest just killing the website.
                <br><br>
                Ironically, they still have accounts in a lot of cases and they still use the website. They complain Paint has "*insert current thing* rehtoric" usually, otherwise its even more non-sensical. I can name several people who complain about Paint, do nothing to actually try to achieve what they want, yet still won't just quit such as Yeuron and Thi500, but that is besides the point as we are here simply to laugh at their foolishness.
                <h4 id="antisdk-c">C. Memes Of SDKcord</h4>
                Yaynikki Gets A Bad Dream:<br>
                <img src="/assets/misc/makepaintgreatagain/antisdk-c_1" alt="yaynikki on 11/29/2023 at 3:36AM - he's personally affected me to the point where, last night, i had a dream where i lose my admin priviledges (I presume due to lack of activity compared to other admins; I didn't find out for sure) and the first thing i discovered was a blog approved by another admin by dc that he was celebrating my demotion" title="yaynikki becomes 3 years old"><br>
                *privileges<br>
                How do you even get to this level-
                <br><br>
                AaronAstro/Thi500 Complains About "Right Wing Rhetoric":<br>
                <img src="/assets/misc/makepaintgreatagain/antisdk-c_2.png" alt="Not even gonna bother alt-texting this, but basically AaronAstro complains about homophobia, transphobia, and RW-rhetoric being allegedly on Paint." title="Aaron loses all awareness of 3DSPaint"><br>
                Is the "homophobia", "transphobia", and "right wing rhetoric" in the room with us right now?<br>
                Seriously though, almost every active member is LGBT, you aren't getting shit by "making the site less homophobic". Name an actually active member that isn't LGBT or mostly chill with LGBT people that isn't literally banned on sight by admins (you can only name like 3 people, all of which are banned and only 2 of which have came back under alt accounts). Your entire argument is either based on deluding yourself to the point of insanity, or based off sources that probably aren't even from SDK itself. And no, one minor incident doesn't represent the entire site so don't even try that bullshit.
                <br><br>
                Yeuron Mad At The Basedness Of TDK:<br>
                <img src="/assets/misc/makepaintgreatagain/antisdk-c_3.png" alt="Yeuron on 8/26/2023 at 3:29PM states - They should just take down the site at this point ... DC has ruined it" title="Yeuron Thinks I Ruined Paint"><br>
                I would love to actually see anyway I made SDK worse, because all I am seeing is improvement. The site was basically dead back when I joined, now we're at the top. I'm doing what y'all claimed you wanted on 3DSPaint, but failed to do. I'm you, but better. If Yeuron thinks I ruined SDK and the site should just be taken down, by all means I believe he should delete his account. He said he would do it once in 2022, but he pussied out and didn't do it. Its easy y'know, the option is there. You aren't in either of the TDK groups, you serve no purpose.
                <br><br>
                There are probably plenty more of examples both newer and older, but I'd prefer to not have to look through everything I have. Plus, that makes this section unnecessarily long.
                <h4 id="antisdk-d">D. Why They Are Usually Harmless</h4>
                They are usually harmless because they do shit like what you just saw in <a href="#antisdk-c">"Memes Of SDKcord"</a>. It is very easy to win a fight against people who literally have dreams about people who they haven't talked to for like 3-4 months, whom complied because they were literally forced to because they don't want to get banned. Seriously, yaynikki shouldn't be acting like this. This is the funniest shit I've ever seen.
                <br><br>
                I thought I had to troll this Discord by stirring shit up occasionally to get them to mald, however it seems that I do not. In fact, they get mad at themselves. They're essentially that one meme where the person makes an imaginary bad-guy then gets scared at that bad-guy. All I am saying is that SDK is currently fucked, we need to fix it, and I simply say it in a rather extreme way.
                <br><br>
                Why? It is because I know people on my side will listen almost no-matter what as they know the whole thing is fucked and we want to save it, however I also know that by stirring shit up with the SDK Discord server, you can get tons of entertainment out of it and these people will take every word without a grain of salt apparently. Thats why they want to shut up about me, but never do even after months. The stuff they complain about is why I even managed to get to my position.
                <br><br>
                If the people against me were actually sane, I wouldn't have anywhere near as much support. However, when the average admin literally uses them having a bad dream about me as a sort of way to say I'm just so mean, their side can't be taken seriously. Thus if I don't get banned, I always win in the end. And if it were as easy as simply making a new TDK/Venith group to be back to normal, I would've won so easily that I wouldn't even have to follow the rules.

                They are harmless half the time because they are dumbasses, they will always lose because they keep playing into it. The only way to win is to not play into it, but they can't even resist it despite them wanting to. Its like an addiction for them, except they can't admit they're obsessed over it. Remember, I can only win because you let me win. However, I always win whenever you always let me win. Actually stop me, and you'll win.

                Remember, this is only funny because your entire side is a bunch of idiots. The moment you get one person who can do all the work of actually destroying my army, you won essentially the entire war. The whole thing essentially devolves into "I am an edgy-badass and you can't stop me motherfucker, I win everytime and piss you all off". However, you're clearly mad so to win, you gotta make it impossible to be framed as mad.

                You'll never win wanting me banned. If I get banned, I'll make 5 alts with different IPs, usernames, and ways of talking. I'll then start hell through those accounts. You'll never win banning accounts who support my side that go as far as I do, they'll just make new accounts or find other ways to support me. The only ways you'll win is making me look like an idiot or ignoring it. Will any of you actually do that? Probably not, so I'll always win. I'm 5 steps ahead of you, I'll be back in a day. Bans are only good as a threat to make me remove it from SDK, in which I will then just go onto my website(s) to do it or more likely for this case, Telegram.
